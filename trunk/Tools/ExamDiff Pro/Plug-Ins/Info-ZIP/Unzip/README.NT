    unzip.exe                   UnZip for NT command line utility, MSVC++ 6.0
    unzipsfx.exe                console mode SFX stub for NT, MSVC++ 6.0
    funzip.exe                  UnZip "filter" utility
    SFXWiz32.exe                GUI mode SFX stub for NT, MSVC++ 6.0
    unzipsfx-gcc.exe            console mode SFX stub for NT, gcc/mingw32
    SFXWiz32-gcc.exe            GUI mode SFX stub for NT, gcc/mingw32


The program executables were compiled with MS Visual C++ 6.0 SP6 (MSC v12.00),
using the win32/Makefile as supplied in the UnZip 5.52 source distribution
(with support for ASM_CRC enabled). Additionally, the sfx stubs have been
compressed by the free exe packer UPX 1.25.

The alternative unzipsfx-gcc.exe and SFXWiz32-gcc.exe stubs were compiled
by gcc 3.2 using the mingw32 environment. These stubs are significantly
smaller, but require the presence of the "msvcrt.dll" C runtime DLL.
Normally, this should not be a problem, since this dll is supplied as part
of the operating system core for Win2k/XP/2K3 and Windows 98/Me. Older Windows
systems (Win95/NT4) support this runtime DLL when Internet Explorer 4.0 (or
newer) is installed. The dll is not supplied in a Win32s environment, but
this should be a minor problem. (For the text-mode stub this is not a
problem at all; Win32s cannot be used to run text-mode applications, anyway.)
