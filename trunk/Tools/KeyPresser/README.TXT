Description
-----------
I wrote this program because my brother wanted to use a cheat with a game.
The cheat requires the user to constantly press a key in order for it to work
so I decided to see if I could write one.  I've seen a program written by
another user that does the same thing except it presses a key for all Windows
(and maybe console) applications.  This is okay if you don't mind the
keypresses showing up in applications you don't want and only want to target
a specific application.

Key Presser was written using Visual Basic and took me only a few hours (on
and off) including the testing and debugging.  It works with all Windows 9x
applications that I have tested with (couple of text editors and two games).
It does not work with console (i.e. command line) applications.
