Recover UPX v1.0 by Quantum
===========================


I. Description
--------------

Recover UPX features are viewing and editing of UPX signature in PE32
files. It doesn't support NE, ELF and any other non-PE32 executables.
If you don't know about UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXecutables) and UPX
"scramblers" (i.e. HidePX, UPX-SCRAMBLER and so on), you'd better get
some info before trying to use this utility.

Why a plug-in for PE Tools instead of a standalone app? The answer is
that PE Tools include a great tool for PE identification, known as PE
Sniffer. It correctly detects UPX  even after those sneaky scramblers
messed up the whole executable.  Another reason is that  you can edit
section names  (and a lot of other fields)  in PE Editor  in order to
recover original UPX sections.  Generally speaking,  PE Tools provide
everything you need to deal with UPX.


II. Usage
---------

Open your packed EXE or DLL. In the case it isn't scrambled  you just
get the complete signature revealed. Nothing to say...

Recover UPX warns you about partially hidden signature.  Anyhow,  you
can let it try to recover lost info.

Some scramblers remove UPX signature completely and Recover UPX won't
guess it's original contents. It gives you the choice to create a new
signature and fill it with default values. There are some hints about
how to recover  the correct  values  in a  well known  article  about
packers, but it's currently available only in Russian  (please, visit
http://www.wasm.ru and http://www.uinc.ru for further info).

Finally,  when  you're done editing the signature  push "Fix" to save
your data. Remember  to restore  the original  UPX section  names  in
PE Editor before trying to unpack.

WARNING!   Always use PE Sniffer or another identification program to
           ensure it's a UPX file. Recover UPX could damage your PE32
           file if it wasn't really UPX-packed.

By the way,  you could use  PE Editor  and  Recover UPX  in order  to
scramble your UPX-packed executable in your very own manner. It won't
save your PE32 against dumpers though.
