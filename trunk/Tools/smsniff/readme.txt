Description
===========

SmartSniff allows you to capture TCP/IP packets that pass through your
network adapter, and view the captured data as sequence of conversations
between clients and servers. You can view the TCP/IP conversations in
Ascii mode (for text-based protocols, like HTTP, SMTP, POP3 and FTP.) or
as hex dump. (for non-text base protocols, like DNS)
SmartSniff provides 3 methods for capturing TCP/IP packets :
1. Raw Sockets (Only for Windows 2000/XP or greater): Allows you to
   capture TCP/IP packets on your network without installing a capture
   driver. This method has some limitations and problems.
2. WinPcap Capture Driver: Allows you to capture TCP/IP packets on all
   Windows operating systems. (Windows 98/ME/NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista) In
   order to use it, you have to download and install WinPcap Capture
   Driver from this Web site. (WinPcap is a free open-source capture
   driver.)
   This method is generally the preferred way to capture TCP/IP packets
   with SmartSniff, and it works better than the Raw Sockets method.
3. Microsoft Network Monitor Driver (Only for Windows 2000/XP/2003):
   Microsoft provides a free capture driver under Windows 2000/XP/2003
   that can be used by SmartSniff, but this driver is not installed by
   default, and you have to manually install it, by using one of the
   following options:
   * Option 1: Install it from the CD-ROM of Windows 2000/XP
     according to the instructions in Microsoft Web site
   * Option 2 (XP Only) : Download and install the Windows XP
     Service Pack 2 Support Tools. One of the tools in this package is
     netcap.exe. When you run this tool in the first time, the Network
     Monitor Driver will automatically be installed on your system.

4. Microsoft Network Monitor Driver 3: Microsoft provides a new
   version of Microsoft Network Monitor driver (3.x) that is also
   supported under Windows 7/Vista/2008. Starting from version 1.60,
   SmartSniff can use this driver to capture the network traffic.
   The new version of Microsoft Network Monitor (3.x) is available to
   download from Microsoft Web site.


Notice: If WinPcap is installed on your system, and you want to use the
Microsoft Network Monitor Driver method, it's recommended to run
SmartSniff with /NoCapDriver, because the Microsoft Network Monitor
Driver may not work properly when WinPcap is loaded too.



System Requirements
===================

SmartSniff can capture TCP/IP packets on any version of Windows operating
system (Windows 98/ME/NT/2000/XP/2003/2008/Vista) as long as WinPcap
capture driver is installed and works properly with your network adapter.
You can also use SmartSniff with the capture driver of Microsoft Network
Monitor, if it's installed on your system.

Under Windows 2000/XP (or greater), SmartSniff also allows you to capture
TCP/IP packets without installing any capture driver, by using 'Raw
Sockets' method. However, this capture method has some limitations and
problems:
* Outgoing UDP and ICMP packets are not captured.
* On Windows XP SP1 outgoing packets are not captured at all - Thanks
  to Microsoft's bug that appeared in SP1 update...
  This bug was fixed on SP2 update, but under Vista, Microsoft returned
  back the outgoing packets bug of XP/SP1.
* On Windows Vista with SP1, only UDP packets are captured. TCP packets
  are not captured at all.
* On Windows 7, it seems that 'Raw Sockets' method works properly
  again, at least for now...

    Network Monitor driver is not supported in these OS)
  * For Microsoft Network Monitor 3.x driver, there is also 'Wifi
    Monitor Mode' button which only works under Windows 7/Vista, and only
    for wireless devices that supports 'Monitor Mode'. When you switch
    the wireless card to monitor mode, SmartSniff can capture all
    unencrypted Wifi/TCP streams in the channel that you chose to monitor.
  * Added support for opening the capture file (.cap) of Microsoft
    Network Monitor 3.x
  * Added support for viewing the content of unencrypted Wifi/TCP
    streams. This feature works on WinPCap driver and Microsoft Network
    Monitor 3.x
  * Added 'Promiscuous Mode' check-box for WinPCap and Microsoft
    Network Monitor 3.x driver. In the previous version, SmartSniff

Using SmartSniff
================

In order to start using SmartSniff, simply copy the executable
(smsniff.exe) to any folder you like, and run it (installation is not
needed).
After running SmartSniff, select "Start Capture" from the File menu, or
simply click the green play button in the toolbar. If it's the first time
that you use SmartSniff, you'll be asked to select the capture method and
the network adapter that you want to use. If WinPcap is installed on your
computer, it's recommended to use this method to capture packets.
After selecting the capture method and your network adapter, click the
'OK' button to start capturing TCP/IP packets. while capturing packets,
try to browse some Web sites, or retrieve new emails from your email
software. After stopping the capture (by clicking the red stop button)
SmartSniff displays the list of all TCP/IP conversations the it captured.
When you select a specific conversation in the upper pane, the lower pane
displays the TCP/IP streams of the selected client-server conversation.

If you want the save the captured packets for viewing them later, use
"Save Packets Data To File" option from the File menu.



Display Mode
============

SmartSniff provides 3 basic modes to display the captured data:
Automatic, Ascii, and Hex Dump. On Automatic mode (the default),
SmartSniff checks the first bytes of the data stream - If it contains
characters lower than 0x20 (excluding CR, LF and tab characters), it
displays the data in Hex mode. otherwise, it displays it in Ascii mode.
You can easily switch between display modes by selecting them from the
menu, or by using F2 - F4 keys. Be aware that 'Hex Dump' mode is much
slower than Ascii mode.

Starting from version 1.35, there is a new mode - 'URL List'. This mode
only display the URL addresses list (http://...) found in the captured
packets.



Exporting the captured data
===========================

SmartSniff allows you to easily export the captured data for using it in
other applications:
* The upper pane: you can select one or more items in the upper pane,
  and then copy them to the clipboard (You can paste the copied items
  into Excel or into spreadsheet of OpenOffice.org) or save them to
  text/HTML/XML file (by using 'Save Packet Summaries').
* The lower pane: You can select any part of the TCP/IP streams (or
  select all text, by using Ctrl+A), copy the selected text to the
  clipboard, and then paste it to Notepad, Wordpad, MS-Word or any other
  editor. When you paste the selected streams to document of Wordpad,
  OpenOffice.org, or MS-Word, the colors are also transferred.
  Your can also export the TCP/IP streams to text file, HTML file, or raw
  data file, by using "Export TCP/IP Streams" option.



Displaying characters above ASCII 127
=====================================

By default, characters above ASCII 127 are not displayed in the TCP/IP
streams. You can enable high ASCII characters by using "Display
Characters Above ASCII 127". When you use this option, the TCP/IP streams
are displayed without colors. Be aware that when working in this mode,
the loading process of the lower pane might be very slow.



The 'IP Country' columns
========================

In order to watch the countries of the local/remote IP addresses, you
have to download the latest IP To Country file from here. You have the
put the 'IpToCountry.csv' file in the same folder of smsniff.exe



Capture and Display Filters
===========================

Starting from version 1.10, you can filter unwanted TCP/IP activity
during the capture process (Capture Filter), or when displaying the
captured TCP/IP data (Display Filter).

For both filter types, you can add one or more filter strings (separated
by spaces or CRLF) in the following syntax:
[include | exclude] : [local | remote | both] : [tcp | udp | tcpudp |
icmp | all] : [IP Range | Ports Range]

Here's some examples that demonstrate how to create a filter string:
* Display only packets with remote tcp port 80 (Web sites):
  include:remote:tcp:80
* Display only packets with remote tcp port 80 (Web sites) and udp port
  53 (DNS):
  include:remote:tcp:80
  include:remote:udp:53
* Display only packets originated from the following IP address range:
  192.168.0.1 192.168.0.100:
  include:remote:all:192.168.0.1-192.168.0.100
* Display only TCP and UDP packets that use the following port range:
  53 - 139:
  include:both:tcpudp:53-139
* Filter most BitTorrent packets (port 6881):
  exclude:both:tcpupd:6881
* Filter all ICMP packets (Ping/Traceroute activity):
  exclude:both:icmp
Notice: A single filter string must not include spaces !



Live Mode
=========

Starting from version 1.10, a new option was added to 'Advanced Options'
section - 'Live Mode'. When SmartSniff capture packets in live mode, the
TCP/IP conversations list is updated while capturing the packets, instead
of updating it only after the capture is finished. Be aware that "Live
Mode" requires more CPU resources than non-live mode. So if your computer
is slow, or your have a very high traffic on your network, it's
recommended to turn off this option.
Starting from version 1.20, you can also view the content of each TCP/IP
conversation (in the lower pane) while capturing the packets. However, if
the TCP/IP conversation is too large, you won't be able to watch the
entire TCP/IP conversation until the capture is stopped.



Viewing process information
===========================

Starting from version 1.30, you can view the process information
(ProcessID and process filename) for captured TCP packets. However, this
feature have some limitations and problems:
* Process information is only displayed for TCP packets (It doesn't
  work with UDP)
* Process information may not be displayed for TCP connections that
  closed after short period of time.
* Retrieving process information consume more CPU resources and may
  slow down your computer. It's not recommended to use this feature if
  you have intensive network traffic.
* Process information is currently not saved in ssp file.
In order to activate this feature, go to 'Advanced Options' dialog-box,
check the "Retrieve process information while capturing packets" option
and click the 'OK' button. 2 new columns will be added: ProcessID and
Process Filename. Start capturing, and process information will be
displayed for the captured TCP conversations.



The structure of .ssp file (SmartSniff Packets File)
====================================================

The structure of .ssp file saved by SmartSniff is very a simple. It
contains one main header in the beginning of the file, followed by
sequence of all TCP/IP packets, each of them begins with a small header.

The main header structure:
00 - SMSNF200 signature.
08 - (2 bytes) The number of bytes in the header (currently 4 bytes for
the IP Address)
0A - (4 bytes) IP Address

Header of each packet:
00 (2 Bytes) packet header size (currently 0x18 bytes)
02 (4 Bytes) number of received bytes in packet.
06 (8 Bytes) Packet time in Windows FILETIME format.
0E (6 Bytes) Source Mac Address.
14 (6 Bytes) Dest. Mac Address.
1A The remaining bytes are the TCP/IP packet itself.



Translating to other languages
==============================

SmartSniff allows you to easily translate all dialog-boxes, menus, and
strings to other language.
In order to do that, follow the instructions below:
1. Run SmartSniff with /savelangfile parameter:
   smsniff.exe /savelangfile
   A file named smsniff_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   SmartSniff utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all menus, dialog-boxes, and string entries to the
   desired language.
4. After you finish the translation, Run SmartSniff, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run SmartSniff without the translation, simply rename
   the language file, or move it to another folder.



Command-Line Options
====================




/StartCapture
Start to capture packets immediately.

/LoadConfig <.cfg filename>
Starts SmartSniff with the specified configuration file.

/NoCapDriver
