Things to do before 2.0 release:
* (?) ebook support
* installer and settings: UI for registering other supported file types http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/issues/detail?id=1365
* bug: focus captured by web control when clicking on "Related Topics" button in 010Editor.chm from
  http://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/issues/detail?id=1579
  I don't know how to fix this. It seems that the problem really is that a button window inside browser
  control captures the focus. I tried hack it by detecting frame window loosing focus (via WM_KILLFOCUS) and
  doing delayed re-capture of focus to frame window, but it doesn't work and it's not the right time to do
  it (it might kill the pop-up menu on the button).
