//      This file contains functions that deal with the list of problems.
//      There are several problem lists.
//      An address may be inserted to any list.

//      is done. The problem lists are accessible for the user
//      from the View->Subviews->Problems menu item.
//      Addresses in the lists are kept sorted.
