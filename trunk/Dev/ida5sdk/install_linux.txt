How to install SDK under Linux
------------------------------

All source files are the same for all platforms and are compiled using the
same makefile. However, since IDA makefiles use Borland format,
we have to preprocess them before passing them to UNIX make.
It is done using the idamake.pl script in the bin subdirectory:

        ~/idasrc/bin/idamake.pl

This script will preprocess the makefile, create a temporary makefile
and launch the make utility on it.

For 64-bit target, define the __EA64__ symbol for make. For example:

        __EA64__=1 ~/idasrc/bin/idamake.pl

will compile a 64 bit linux module.

Creating an alias for this commands is a good idea. I have the following in my
.bashrc file:

alias m='idamake.pl 2>&1'
alias mm='__EA64__=1 idamake.pl 2>&1'

-----------------------------------------------

        Installation:

0. Unzip the archive to the directory of your choice ($HOME/idasrc is ok)

1. Edit the allmake.unx file to modify path to the sdk (the IDA variable)

2. Add the $(IDA)/bin directory to your PATH

3. Copy libida*.so files from your ida distribution to the idasdk/bin directory.
